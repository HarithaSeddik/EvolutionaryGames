Modeling Mobility Interactions in Population Biodiversity 
	
Attempted to recreate paper in Nature journal, that aims to model the effect of mobility on biodiversity based on rock-paper-scissor game model (mathematical Evolutionary Game Theory model). 

This was done as a final project for Computational Methods for Material Science (MSN514) course. 


Original Paper: 
Reichenbach, T., Mobilia, M., &amp; Frey, E. (n.d.). Mobility promotes and jeopardizes biodiversity in rock–paper–scissors games. Nature News. https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06095/. 

The code was written in Matlab, and the functioning code is attached to this repository
